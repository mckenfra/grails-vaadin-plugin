The plugin supports two styles of usage:

* *Base-Style*: Simply exposes the base Vaadin [Application|api:com.vaadin.Application], leaving the developer to build the interface programmatically using Java/Groovy classes.
* *Grails-Style*: Allows the developer to construct an application using Grails-style Controllers and GSP Views, supported by a Vaadin tag library.

This guide assumes the user prefers to utilise the *Grails-Style* architectural
pattern. See a comparison of the styles and further details [here|guide:3.11 Base-Style vs Grails-Style].
