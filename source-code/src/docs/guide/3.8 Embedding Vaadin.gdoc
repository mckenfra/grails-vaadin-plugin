The plugin provides the [create-vaadin-embedded|Command Line] command which allows you
to easily [embed|https://vaadin.com/book/-/page/application.embedding.html]
your Vaadin application in a Grails page.

The benefit of this approach is that your Vaadin Application is then hosted inside
a @<div>@ in a regular Grails view. You can then customize the 'host' view like any
other Grails view - e.g use Sitemesh, or include other javascript and CSS resources
using the @<r:resource>@ tag. The Vaadin Application then just becomes one section of
the page.
