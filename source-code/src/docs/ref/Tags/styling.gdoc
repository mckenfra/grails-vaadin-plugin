h1. Styling for Tags

h2. Purpose

A Vaadin tag does not translate to a single HTML tag. Some additional tag attributes are provided
to allow you to get the CSS effect you are after.

h2. Examples

{code:java}
<v:label class="mylabel">Hello World!</v:label>

<v:label class="mylabel" wrapperClass="wrapper_for_mylabel">Hello World!</v:label>

<v:label class="mylabel" wrapperStyle="display:inline;">Hello World!</v:label>
{code}

h2. Description

When you insert a Vaadin tag into a @.gsp@ page, be aware that it is not a simple HTML-style
tag. Ã…ttributes such as @class@ and @style@ may not behave as you would expect.

Vaadin constructs its components using varying numbers of @<div>@ elements. For an understanding
of the div styling rules for a particular Vaadin component type, you should look up the component
in the [Components Section|http://vaadin.com/book/-/page/components.html] in the Book of Vaadin.
For example, see the styles that apply to the @Table@ component at the bottom of
[this page|https://vaadin.com/book/-/page/components.table.html#components.table.css]

However, Vaadin does provide a @class@ attribute for all components. You can use this
to set the CSS for a particular component, noting that it may also nest some divs within it.

{note}
The HTML/CSS @style@ attribute is not available to Vaadin components!

h4. CSS and Layouts

If a Vaadin component tag is placed directly into a @.gsp@ file without being wrapped by a layout
tag such as [horizontalLayout|Tags], then it gets automatically wrapped by a @<div>@ tag. E.g. you may
have the following in a file called @list.gsp@:

{code:java}
<!-- Wrapper CSS applied to automatically-generated parent div -->

<v:label wrapperStyle="background: red;">Hello World!</v:label>
{code}

The [label|Tags] will be rendered with a @<div>@ wrapped around it.

To get the layout effect you want, you can use the @wrapperClass@ and/or @wrapperStyle@
attributes to apply a CSS class / inline-style to the wrapper @<div>@ tag itself.

Note that if the Vaadin component tag is placed within a layout tag such as
[horizontalLayout|Tags] then no @<div>@ wrapper tag is placed around it, and the
@wrapperClass@ and @wrapperStyle@ attributes will be ignored. E.g. if your @list.gsp@ is as follows,
then it will just be attached directly to the @<v:horizontalLayout>@ with no @<div>@ wrapper:

{code:java}
<!-- Wrapper CSS is ignored, as parent is a Vaadin layout tag -->
 
<v:horizontalLayout>
  <v:label wrapperStyle="background: red">Hello World!</v:label>
</v:horizontalLayout>
{code}

h2. Attributes

The following attributes are available to all Vaadin component tags:

* @class@ (optional) The CSS class to apply to the component itself.

* @wrapperClass@ (optional) The CSS class to use for the @<div>@ wrapper that contains this component (if it exists).

* @wrapperStyle@ (optional) The CSS inline-style to use for the @<div>@ wrapper that contains this component (if it exists).
